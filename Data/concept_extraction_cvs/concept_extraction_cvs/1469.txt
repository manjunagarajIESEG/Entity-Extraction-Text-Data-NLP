Project #1: RCI DS6000 Verification & Validation Client Name: Rockwell Collins Inc. Role: Software Engineer Skill/Tools: Model Based Development Environment, Simulink, VAPS XT, Python Scripting, DO-178B Level A and Level B Requirement, ARINC 429 protocol, Doors, SVN, PREP, Clear Case & Quest Simulator: VISTA (Virtual Integrated Software Test Bed for Avionics)  Project Details:  The DS6000 Display Control System (DS6000-DCS) Verification activity involves Requirements Based Testing and MCDC/Structural Coverage Analysis for the DS6000-DCS software. The DCS applications are developed in accordance with RTCA DO-178B level A and B development standards. The verification activities will be performed in accordance with RCI provided standards, procedures, and plans to will meet the requirements of DO178B- Level A and Level B.  The Display and Crew Alerting system has interfaces to many systems within the overall DS6000-DCS avionics system. ARINC661 is the primary interfaces between external applications and displays.  Responsibilities involved:  ➢ Responsible for developing Test Cases and Test Procedures as per requirements (Black box testing) and model implementation. ➢ Involved in Performing Structural Coverage Analysis for the developed Test Scripts with LDRA (white box testing). ➢ Executing the test scripts on the simulator(re host- VISTA) ➢ Performing Peer Reviews ➢ Bug Tracking and reporting using Clear Quest tool. ➢ Responsible for performing I/O testing of Arinc429 and AFDX Ethernet protocol on the simulator, signal is simulated in 'Signal Generator' and the output is mapped in 'Signal Analyzer'. ➢ Mentoring and training new engineers. ➢ Leading a group of 3 engineers in completing a module, additional responsibilities involve technical support. ➢ Identifying requirements and model mismatch and reporting back to the development team with the Change request. ➢ Raise clarification  in case of inconsistency in requirement or simulator  environment  Project #2: RTSA Client Name: Rockwell Collins Inc. Role: Verification Engineer Skill/Tools: Python Scripting, DO-178B Level A and Level B Requirement, ARINC 429                                        protocol, Doors, SVN, PREP, Clear Case & Quest Simulator: VISTA (Virtual Integrated Software Test Bed for Avionics) Project Details: The primary purpose of the RTSA Product Software is to provide the user/pilot with a Radio Tuning interface to retrieve input data from the varied user input devices, format and process user input data for dissemination, and send radio tuning commands to the real radios. The RTSA software interface can receive radio tune requests from the Flight Management System Application (FMSA), dissimilar tuning equipment, radio feedback, and user/pilot entries for a variety of avionic radios.  Responsibilities involved:  ➢ Developing Test Cases and Test Procedures as per the DO - 178B Level-A Requirements ➢ Performing Dry run on simulator environment and creating the log file for each module. ➢ Performing Structural Coverage Analysis for the entire module. ➢ Identifying requirements and model mismatch and reporting back to the development team with the Change request. Raise clarification  in case of inconsistency in requirement or simulator  environment
