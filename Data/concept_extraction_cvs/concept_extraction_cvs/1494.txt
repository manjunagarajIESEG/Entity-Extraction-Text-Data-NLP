DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMMING AND ADMISSIONS
PGiP - Glen Echo, MD
I am currently the Director of Programming and Admissions for PGiP. I have earned more responsibility each year while continually increasing enrollment and revenue. My drive has improved the experience for families as well as staff at PGiP. • Increased enrollment to record numbers, filling the majority of programs within hours. • Started Little Echoes drop-off program for 3-5 year olds and grew it to full enrollment after two years. • Created wait lists for over 75% of PGiP classes. • Coordinated all school-wide events and weekly field trips. • Directed all staff meetings.
