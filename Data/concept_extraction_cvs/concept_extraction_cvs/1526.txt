Project: SLS - Non-cash Incentive Wallet - Update Certificates Environment: Java/J2EE, Struts 1.x, DB2 Universal database, JSP, HTML, CSS, XML, WebSphere Application Server v8.5, RAD, SOAP Web Services, LINUX.  Description: The eNCI application orders the certificates to its customers from Deltamatic with the help of SOA services. Life cycle of the certificates is maintained by Deltamatic system. The proposed system enables the eNCI application authorized users to manage the life cycle of the certificates. SOAP web service is implemented to check the certificate status, update the certificate status in the eNCI application. Limit of the certificates per transaction is also managed. Some of the statuses are OPEN, CLOSED, EXPIRED.  Responsibilities: • Analyzing requirement and giving estimations for implementation • Have involved and designed the complete project. • Understanding the current code base and preparing the design document  for new enhancements • Preparing DB designs changes. • Coordinating with offshore for requirement analysis and implementation. • Doing code review for offshore code changes • Implemented SOAP Web services. • Managing and deploying build in Linux environment using Secure CRT for the WebSphere server • Writing and reviewing test cases and plan for System integration and UAT  Client: Delta Air Lines, Inc., MN        Nov, 15 - Till Date Role: Sr. Java Developer Project: Air 4 - Virgin Atlantic Environment: PingFederate, Java/J2EE, Struts 1.x, DB2 Universal database, JSP, HTML, CSS, XML, WebSphere Application Server v8.5, RAD, LINUX.  Description: This project involves two major implementations, one is making the eNCI application as Airline Neutralized app by doing this, the eNCI application will be used by Virgin Atlantic airline which is Delta's code share partner and this application can be used by any other Airlines in future.
