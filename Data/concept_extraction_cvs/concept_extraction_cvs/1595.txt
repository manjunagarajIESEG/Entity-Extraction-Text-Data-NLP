Project: eCatalog This is an internal UBS project for building their catalog for distribution to clients. ECatalog management includes data sourcing, customization and publishing. The first stage is the data sourcing. Here all the information needed for catalog management is aggregated. Various sources provide the data required. These sources, Eclipse, GPSY, PATSY, contain product, pricing, purchasing, order management and all other necessary information. In the customization section the catalog is into action. The catalog engine which is present works with this database to provide the required customization. The final stage is publishing. In this stage the engine outputs the catalogs into third party websites such as E-Prime, E-Procurement and traditional Non E-customers.  Responsibilities: ● Involved in the analysis, design, development, testing and production of the application. ● Participated in daily Team meetings for problem solving, progress updates, and brainstorming; ● Worked with Business users to identify new requirements and creation of new tasks. ● Developed use cases, workflow, screen mock-ups, and conversion requirements. ● Used JQuery, AngularJS and JavaScript for client side validations and page layouts. ● Developed the business logic of the application using Spring and Hibernate components. ● Worked on providing XMLs in readable formats using DOM parsers. ● Used TOAD for accessing MySQL Server. ● Daily work also included accessing linux based servers and running daily Autosys jobs for pushing data to database through MQ. ● Involved in Code Reviews and Code Cleanup for modules.  Environment: Java 1.6, J2EE, Spring, JDBC, JSP, Servlets, XML, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Angular JS, Toad, Oracle 11g, Tomcat, JBoss 4.x, Eclipse, Autosys, WMQ.
