It is flexible for users to customize the views and reports of the market entities based on their choices and requirements like current face value, market value and historical data and other details. Risk is that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by change in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short term harrowing s, long term debts, trading account assets, liabilities, mortgage, banking activities and derivatives. Market Risk Applications belongs to an architect, engineer, designer, subject matter expert developer, or business expert/analyst supporting technology solutions which effectively influence and lead cross functional teams to extract meaningful & actionable conclusions from the data analyzed; clearly and crisply communicate decisions and opinions.

Programming on Flex/Java/MSTR. MRX is the Market Risk Web Portal which housed specific risk applications such as VaR Reporting and Limits. Market Risk is the risk that the value of assets, liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market Risk arises from the fluctuating prices of securities and other investments as they are traded in the global markets. Prices of holdings change on a daily basis. Market Risk always exists, its varying impact, however, is dependant on the external environment.  IRC/CRM Incremental Risk Change/ Comprehensive Risk Measure - All these are used to calculate charges that are needed so that we can adequately sound if ever things blow up. It started monitoring them on weekly basis. When there are changes, we've to explain what caused this change. Since data is so vast and since the calculations are on one file, but the exposures on another we need a tool to marry the two sets. So we can quickly say that our IRC/CRM went up because of x positions. Where this x position decreased y amount or if any new product came in causing the IRC/CRM numbers to change. Impact Analysis Part of the IA development team. Programming on Quartz framework using Python. Quartz is a proprietary Python framework used in Market Risk to build services and both web and desktop front ends on departmental risk applications.
