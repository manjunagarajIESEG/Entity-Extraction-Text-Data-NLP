Data Researcher
Sharp Laboratories of America
Developed and deployed corporate intranet platform for data visualization and analytics using Python, Django, PostgreSQL backend.  Responsible for front end as well.  Authored HTML & CSS, integrated Bootstrap and Jquery/JqueryUI tools. Lived and breathed Python on daily basis. Rescued struggling project (database build times were prohibitively slow, as were user queries against the data.  Quantitative results were unreliable and inaccurate.)  Applied techniques for query tuning, caching, denormalization of data for performance improvements. Identified and eliminated causes of quantitative inaccuracies. Migrated platform from physical server to virtual environment. Took it from development into production by wiring up a Gunicorn, Supervisord, and Nginx stack.  Managed multiple (database, web, development) Linux (Fedora) server instances. Developed data analytic tools using Python Pandas, and visualizations using Matplotlib and Bokeh. Automated database build process and data loading pipelines.  Consumed external APIs and wrote RESTful API using Django REST Framework.  Equally comfortable working within the Django ORM or writing native SQL in Postgres. Mixed the two where appropriate. Rebuilt positive relations with clients.  Prepared end-user documentation/user manual. Provided user training at client site. Generalized the existing platform for use in subsequent future projects.  Tools and methods developed for analyzing and visualizing the product sale-return-repair process were employed for assisting in the management of the corporate IPR portfolio. Prototyped development of search platform using ElasticSearch. Developed under a GIT and JIRA workflow using the PyCharm IDE.
