University of Houston - Houston, TX
Accomplishments • Integrate a lab-made sonicator with the atomic magnetometer (AM) to measure the ultrasound force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (usFIRMS), and finish the automation by LabVIEW. The new parts of instrument were machined with lathe and milling/drilling machine and printed 3D by SOLIDWORKS. This new technique is applied on various biological systems to measure the force between biomolecules accurately and efficiently.  • Develop graphical user interface (GUI) programs to analyze the FIRMS and count the number of magnetic particles under the high-resolution optical microscope precisely and accurately through the computer vision and handpicking in Python and MATLAB versions. C++ is used to optimize and fasten codes.  • Develop MATLAB programs to obtain and analyze images of the ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at room temperature. • Study the ribosomal translocation and programmed ribosomal frameshifting by FIRMS, and suggest the new mechanism in protein translation and algorithm to track the movement of ribosome with single nucleotide resolution in situ. The suggested new frameshifting products are further proved through the protein expression after collaborating with the biological laboratory.  Skills Used Python, MATLAB, C++, Solidworks, Lathe, Milling/Drilling machine, Atomic magnetometer (AM), labview
