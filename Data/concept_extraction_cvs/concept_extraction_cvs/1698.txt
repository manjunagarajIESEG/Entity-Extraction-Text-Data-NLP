Staff SYSTEM PRODUCT VALIDATION ENGINEER
LATTICE SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION - San Jose, CA
Developing characterization strategies, plans, and schedules by integrating different silicon system solution requirements from various engineering departments. ♦ High speed board development. ♦ Silicon system solution characterization, especially video and image conversion from MIPI to LVDS/subLVDS/CMOS and reversed. ♦ Characterize complex FPGA and Flash FPGA with emphasis on high performance IO interface, LED IO, PWM, OSC, PLL, DDR, CDR, EBR, MIPI D-PHY, C-PHY, M-PHY, SERDES ♦ Bring up, validate, and characterize PCIE, XAUI, XGMII, and GbE sub and full systems. ♦ Bring up, validate, and characterize DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR2, and LPDDR3 sub and full systems. ♦ Characterization executing involves generating patterns and test vectors, performing ATE and bench measurements using state-of-the-art characterization equipment, data analysis and yield improvement, presenting results, and generating reports ♦ Taking ownership from "first silicon" to transfer to manufacturing ♦ Debugging new software and netlist for new products ♦ Lead and train new RCGs on FPGA product architecture and test performance. ♦ Create Python bench equipment drivers and automate bench data collector.
