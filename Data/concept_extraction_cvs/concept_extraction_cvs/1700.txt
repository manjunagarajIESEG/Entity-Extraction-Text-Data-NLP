Pattern Recognition on Brain Regions via Regression Modeling - Keywords: data mining; pattern recognition; regression; Python; feature extraction • Performed data preprocessing by eliminating outliers in the raw data, which includes measurements on 165 brain regions for 81 subjects • Applied forward feature selection and regularized linear regression to identify regions of interest (ROIs) to- wards a given target region • Achieved a normalized MSE of 8.2e-4 for a 5-fold cross validation, and will investigate overlap between the extracted 25 ROIs and the ground truth from literature on physiology  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Diagnosis with Brain Connectivity Pattern Analysis - Keywords: machine learning; classification; AdaBoost; Python; data analysis • Constructed the feature space by applying Pearson correlation to six pairs of brain regions based on neu- roimaging data • Applied linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to extract the most distinguishable information in the selected feature space • Performed a three-class classification using AdaBoost with 50 decision-tree classifiers, achieving an accuracy of 76% in the leave-one-out cross validation  Efficient and Secure System Design in Wireless Communications - Keywords: game theory; cryptography; security; Matlab; optimization • Proposed a game theoretic approach to find the optimal strategy for multichannel communications under cog- nitive jamming, where the jammer monitors the authorized user and adapts its jamming strategy accordingly • Applied physical layer cryptographic techniques to enhance the security of existing 3G CDMA schemes under disguised jamming, where the jammer mimics the authorized signal using a similar transmission pattern • Developed new efficient message-driven multicarrier schemes, which outperform existing 4G OFDM schemes in both spectral and power efficiency by up to 25%
