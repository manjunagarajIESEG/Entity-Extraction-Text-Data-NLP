Embedded SW Engineering Intern
Audio for Video Group, Bose Corporation - Framingham, MA
• Designed an I2C communication high-level protocol between the STM32 F0 and STM32 F2 microprocessors made to support the multitude of differing use-cases required by HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) and power control logic. • Created a Raspberry Pi CEC Test Harness. Utilized a modified open source LibCEC driver with added additional behavior to allow for reading of raw data messages. This library powered an end-to-end standalone automated stress test written in Python 3.2 that tested up/downstream CEC communications with respect to data integrity and higher-level embedded (I2C) communications. • Designed a HTTP communication protocol and implemented on a Python 2.7 HTTP server that allowed for the Python 3.2 standalone test to be integrated into existing, older Python 2.7 automated test framework and seamlessly launched along with existing tests in release, continuous, nightly fashion. • Collaborated on the creation of STM32F0 Eval platform serial-driven CEC peripheral in C on a FreeRTOS base.
