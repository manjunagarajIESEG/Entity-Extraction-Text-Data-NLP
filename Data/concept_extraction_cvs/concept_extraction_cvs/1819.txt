Design Validation Engineer
GainSpan(IoT) - San Jose, CA
Wrote validation plan and created chip-level validation tests (Python), including sanity check test (OTP check, PHY, Top and Core Registers check, AT commands check) and network throughout test (TCP/UDP TX/RX combinations). Collected data on wifi modules and analyzed network performance by plotting charts of throughput(Mbps) VS TX power(dB) • Develop automated RX PER sensitivity test (Python) with user friendly menu options, featured with configurable user input (test channels, data rates, power range, etc.), automatically store test information and data to Excel file and plot charts. • Wrote RF receiver DCO calibration algorithm(C code), debugged with JTAG, built FW binary and wrote script (Python) to verify the algorithm and test if DCO within desired range (+/-50mV). • Wrote automation test (Auto-it programming) to control Tektronix Logical Analyzer, run RX calibration test (Python), and collect ADC data to Excel file. • Designed bench test automation (LabVIEW) for WLAN RF characterization tests. Automated control of lab equipment including Spectrum Analyzer, Logic Analyzer, Power Supply, Digital Multi-meter and Signal Generator. • Research Assistant, CHREC @ University of Florida
