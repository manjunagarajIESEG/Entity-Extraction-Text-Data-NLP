System Engineer
MAXLINEAR, INC - Carlsbad, CA
− Terrestrial System: o Investigated and resolved the issue for China customers. o Worked on schematic and layout changes for new PCB modifications. o Minimized the design changes on original circuitry and performance degradation (sensitivity, S-parameter, etc.). o Composed formal test report, HW design guide, and application note. − Satellite System: o Analyzed FSK system based on customers’ requirements for a satellite ODU IC. Worked on system specification analysis (such as ADC/DAC performance analysis and on-chip filter/external diplexer analysis) to provide detailed chip and system level specifications in analog/digital blocks for IC teams. Composed formal SRD (System Requirement Document) for FSK system. o Specified system level DVT (design-verification-test) plan for FPGA and chip. FPGA and silicon test environment bring-up (includes software-hardware integration) for DVT plan. o Defined FSK APIs (functions and argument) and GUI for customer. o ATE (automatic test environment) development for FSK system tests and BT/CS system tests by using LabVIEW. o Wrote GUI for home-build FPGA test board by using Python. o Defined filter requirements for FSK external diplexer and characterized the external diplexer on PCB board. o FPGA and chip verification for the DVT (MER, Aggregate output power, ripple, Tx emission, Boot ROM, etc.) o Debugged with design teams on IC issues and characterized chip performance by tweaking register values. o Lead of DVT for corner parts. − Cable System: o Developed equipment drivers for ATE in LabVIEW. o Worked with ASIC team to finalize system level FPGA requirements. o Experienced in cable standards: DOCSIS 3.0/3.1 and MoCA 2.0. o Understanding of TDMA and OFDMA systems.
