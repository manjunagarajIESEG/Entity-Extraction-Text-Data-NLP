Embedded Software Developer
Visteon Corporation - Van Buren, MI
Responsibilities • Develop components for processors on the GM Cluster software in Embedded C in QNX environment • Create, modify and maintain Python libraries for the autotest suite designed for automated testing purpose • Automate Python scripts at the Pre-Integration Test (PIT) level once components are developed and tested at unit level • Develop bash, shell and batch scripts to build source files for the software. This includes integration management of build systems with coverity analysis and archiving binary images using Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) software. Version control systems such as Rational Team Concert (RTC), Serena Dimensions, Polytron Version Control System (PVCS) and GIT are used • Flash binaries onto hardware using QNX Momentics and Freescale Manufacturing Tool • Run smoke test, comprehensive sanity test for GP components on GM clusters, and maintain error logs at white box level of testing. Testing is done both on bench and as well as in vehicle • System testing for the VP-GP communication using CAN traffic through CANoe over CANCase XL, and testing for functionality. This includes positive tests, negative tests, boundary tests, etc. at black box level • Develop python scripts and use the cron utility to automate the building process to run regression at fixed time periods. Automation was done for building, flashing, smoke testing and sanity testing for the GM Global B GP • Documentation of build procedures of GM Global B GP using QNX Momentics Tool Suite and Jenkins CI, and flash procedures using the JTAG box method, QNX Momentics Tool Suite and Freescale Manufacturing Tool • Creation of baselines for the Global B GP project on Serena Dimensions • Maintenance of a version number scheme for the builds (release/delivery number, major sprint number, minor build number, etc.)  Accomplishments • Hands-on experience working with instrument panel cluster software, gained a lot of knowledge in the automotive embedded industry • Had a great exposure in both the development and in the automation testing sectors of embedded software  Skills Used Programming Languages: C, C++, LINUX/UNIX based languages Scripting Language: Python, Perl, Bash Shell, Batch Development Environments: QNX (Momentics), Linux (gcc, gdb), Windows (Visual Studio) Protocols: CAN, MOST, LIN, SPI, I2C Software: QNX Momentics, CANoe, K2L, Green Hills MULTI, RTC, FP5, Freescale Manufacturing Tool Hardware: CANCase XL, MOCCA, FlashPro
