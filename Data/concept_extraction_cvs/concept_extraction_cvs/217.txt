Research Assistant on Cumulative Citation Recommendation project. Project aims to filter vital documents for set of entities in an incoming stream of documents. Entities are person/organization/concept from English Wikipedia. A document enhancing existing knowledge about entities is considered as vital. Each document in corpus/dataset has creation time stamp. Proposed system/algorithms should process document in a chronological order. In addition, the proposed systems have constraint of not using information from future. The size of corpus is around 20TB. The work is divided in three subtasks - creation of queries for entities using different approaches, implementation of various statistical information retrieval models and evaluation of the retrieval models. Proposed approaches of query creation include using semantic web data, using judged documents from corpus. Implemented Information retrieval models are Language model, Poisson model, BM25 model and KL Divergence. These models are implemented to process documents in real time (chronological order). Evaluation of models is performed using standard information retrieval measures such as precision, recall and f1 score. We conduct various test such as student t test to effectively compare different models for each of these measures. We create and perform variety of experiments with different parameters for each of the implemented models so as to enable a robust comparison of models. Project implementation with C++, C, Python and R.
