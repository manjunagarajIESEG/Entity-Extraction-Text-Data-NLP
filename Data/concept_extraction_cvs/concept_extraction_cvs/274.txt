Laurel, MD                  February 2013 - Current Senior Staff Engineer, Air & Missile Defense Department  Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the fields of multiple-body dynamics, structural dynamics, and vibra- tion/shock analysis. Experience with Standard missile variants, Evolved Sea-Sparrow missile, and Conven- tional Prompt Strike missile. Specific areas of experience include:  • Formulate first principles mathematical models of missile systems - Design optimal avionics shock and vibration isolation systems using non-linear, visco-elastic iso- lators - Develop numerical simulation engines to compute multiple, coupled, 6 degree-of-freedom system dynamics - Perform design level studies of encanistered missile systems subjected to high-energy shock tran- sients - Co-developed a high-fidelity missile egress simulation tool which incorporates launch rail vibratory modes coupled to rigid-body missile dynamics • Develop, perform, and analyze innovative experimental investigations - Conduct modal testing on missile system components via impact hammer and electro-dynamic shaker excitations - Assess optimal experimental configurations and post-processing parameters using design of ex- periments methodologies - Utilize resources across the laboratory sectors to perform non-standard environmental testing and parameter identification - Formulated analysis and experimental methodology to identify and quantify non-linearities in vibratory modes • Model and simulate systems with finite element methods - Simulate static and dynamic responses of missile representative beam models to a wide range of inputs and boundary conditions - Generate high-fidelity complex models with non-linear elastic elements to assess transient dynamic responses - Write custom Matlab and Python scripts to post process NASTRAN text output files and Abaqus binary outputs efficiently - Developing automated finite element model updating tool • Present results and recommendations of relevant studies to government sponsor agencies and program management.
