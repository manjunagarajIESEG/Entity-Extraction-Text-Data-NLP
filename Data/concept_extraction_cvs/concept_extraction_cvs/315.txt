R&D Electrical Engineer
U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
• Developed SPICE models to simulate the transfer function of corrosion protection circuitry. • Supported electromagnetic interferance and mechanical shock testing of corrosion protection electronics qualifying MIL STD 461F, DoD STD 1399, and MIL STD 901D; respectively. • Set up experiments and associated NI DAQ hardware to measure grounding contact impedances. • Implemented Gamry potentiostats to measure the voltage response of Hall effect current sensors. • Developed Python scripts used to reduce testing data and perform frequency analysis via FFT's and statistical analysis via ANOVA and histogram calculations. • Derived circuit equations modeling parasitic inductances and analyzed their effects on system load impedances by fitting test data to said equations via least squares regression in Python. • Wrote Visual Basic scripts for the SolidWorks API to automate optimization of 3D solid models. • Used FEA to evaluate the galvanic corrosion resistance of materials used on naval weapons systems.
