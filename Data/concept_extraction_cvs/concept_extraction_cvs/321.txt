•    Worked on a Department of Veterans Affairs project.  The prime of the project was CACI.  The agile team of this project employed more than 60 technical staff to develop middleware interfaces for the communication between consumer/producer applications and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Data Access Service (DAS).  And VLER is a tangible collection of documents and records associated with any service member or veteran.   •    During the first two and half years, the technologies used for coding the communication interfaces were Java with the Spring framework, XSLT, Web Service RESTful, Maven, SVN (for version control), Junit (for unit tests), soapUI (for functional testing) , Eclipse, Oracle database on the WebLogic application server in the Windows operating system environment.  Thereafter, new technologies were introduced.  All developers on the team became familiarized with NodeJS, mocha (for unit tests), GIT (for version control), mongoDB under the Virtual Machine environment. •    Coded JUnit tests on functionality additions; •    Used the soapUI, REST client to execute queries with various request parameters, test and verify the application code based on the validity of the retrieved data; •    JIRA was used for tracking the flow of team activities.
