Supported the Invasive Species Forecasting System (ISFS) Project at GSFC.  ISFS is a joint effort by NASA and the Department of the Interior to use NASA data and technology to help operational agencies with their invasive species management processes.  The project focused on integrating Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data into a system with Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) statistical modeling software to test the application of both against a standard regression model analysis of invasive species potential habitat.  Accomplishments: • Developed scientific software in Python to integrate and test application of MaxEnt java package and MERRA data to predict potential habitat of invasive species. • Developed Python application for accessing MERRA Analytic Services (MERRA/AS) data and producing a climate model variable collection. • Numerically analyzed statistical models produced by MaxEnt using the MERRA/AS climate model variables to find MERRA variables with strongest and weakest influence on the models. • Compared results of variables with strongest influence in MaxEnt models with the previous regression model analysis to produce scientific paper detailing results. • Coordinated with other NASA programs/centers, government agencies, computing centers and universities to exchange technical ideas and explore potential solutions based around data publication and distribution. • Identified new customers and applications that might benefit from climate data products and services.
