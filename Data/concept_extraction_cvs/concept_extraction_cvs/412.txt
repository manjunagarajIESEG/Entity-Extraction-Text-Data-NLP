Data Scientist
Nexidia - Atlanta, GA
Used ensemble classification algorithms such as Random Forests to improve and rework an existing churn prediction model for a major cable operator. Feature selection and algorithm parameters were selected using recursive feature elimination and searching a grid of parameters (coarse, then fine) using cross-validation. Loaded and extracted evaluation data provided by the customer. Prepared reports evaluating model against out-of-sample churn experience. • Troubleshoot and improve existing production churn model in R. Wrote R code to train new version of the random forest model and evaluate current model. Evaluated multiprocessing infrastructure in R versus python. Rewrote production prediction process in Python using scikit-learn and pandas. Integrated new model into the existing production system. • Wrote Cython wrapper around Nexidia C++ libraries used to read tens of thousands of transcript files along with metadata. • Wrote feature extraction code to reproduce a SVM model from a published paper in order to classify zones (disclaimer, etc) in emails.
