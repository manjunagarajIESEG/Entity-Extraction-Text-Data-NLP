Python - Newcastle upon Tyne
Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK ✓ We created html5 set top box interfaces. I did all the JavaScript. ✓ We invented the one page web app, four years ago, ✓ We built set top interfaces for three separate clients, including one of the largest cable providers in Europe. ✓ All three interfaces are currently in production. ✓ I developed advanced techniques for handling massive amounts of data in a web app. ✓ The electronic programming guide handles over 400,000 records that's 2500 channels, each with 14 days worth of listings and will load quickly on a cell phone. No other program guide engine has even 1/3 the capacity. ✓ The EPG engine I wrote is recognized as the fastest and highest capacity JavaScript epg engine available. ✓ I wrote a validating no-xml xml parser to convert xmltv format data feeds to Indexed JSON. ✓ Indexed JSON is a modified form of JSON I developed to reduce data size, and keep the page fast and responsive. ✓ We have used HTML5 media elements extensively for years. I even know how to trick them in to caching properly. ✓ We enhanced the HTML5 video element with fast forward, slow motion, rewind, and deterministic source preloading for seamless and super fast channel changes. ✓ I wrote the swama loader, it reloads the web app data every 24 hours, with no blinking, no reloading, no spinning gifs. It does not even pause the user interface. ✓ Mapped all functionality to remote control for spatial navigation. ✓ Integrated html Video tag with enhanced functionality for rewind, fast forward, slow motion, and preloading for fast channel changing. ✓ Created client-side Internet video search engine with HTML 5 local storage. ✓ I learned how to work with graphic artists. Gamma5 is nothing but graphic artists and myself.  I also had to ensure that it looked exactly as they wanted. ✓ I am very well versed in HTML5 Performance optimization.
