Responsibilities Expressed and purified human fructose-1,6-biphosphate brain aldolase (HBA) glycolytic enzyme. HBA is implicated in neurological diseases such as autism, dementia, severe mental retardation, Alzheimer’s, Parkinsons and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Obtained a high-resolution  structure (2.0Å) throught X-ray and crystallography. From this structure, important features specific to this enzyme were identified the impact of and mutations impact was estimated.   Accomplishments E.S Rangarajan, H. Park, E. Fortin, J. Sygush and T. Izard, J. Biol. Chem., 285, 11983-11990, 2010.  Skills Used High quality purification of proteins (AKTA : DEAE/Phenyl/FPLC/HPLC) Protein characterisation (SDS-PAGE, Mass spectrometry, Kinetic activity assay) Crystallography and X-ray synchrotron (NSLS) Bioinformatics (Python scripting, Mascot, Scaffold, HKL2000, Pymol, Coot, Emacs, Linux) In vitro RNA synthesis (T7 polymerase) DNA expression/extraction/purification/cloning
