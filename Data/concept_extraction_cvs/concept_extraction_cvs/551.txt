Research Assistant
New York University, Department of Physics - New York, NY
Responsibilities Programming in Python, C, R, SQL Fortran. Apply statistical techniques to large-scale survey data.   Accomplishments Under supervision of David W. Hogg, developed new computational methods based in machine learning for CMB surveys, including method to compute CMB likelihood over heteroscedastic data and new foreground separation techniques.  My present research includes designing algorithms and implementing them. My work heavily relies upon Python scientific modules (e.g. numpy, scikit-learn) and Jupyter notebooks to develop and unit test code, with extensions like Cython for speed. Recent projects have included developing Gaussian process kernels to encapsulate CMB priors, developing methods to do component separation on astronomical maps, and developing a probabilistic PCA-based approach to model galaxy spectra.  Developed algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization for SDSS spectra. Utilizes dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning to train SDSS spectra basis and coefficients in order to find double-redshifts. Algorithms upon Python multithreading and R. SDSS data accessed via SQL. Paper to be published soon. https://github.com/evanbiederstedt/HMF2.0  Developed software and algorithms based on Gaussian Processes to evaluate the marginal likelihood function on CMB pixels from Planck all-sky maps. Developed expressive Gaussian Process kernels to encapsulate cosmological priors; algorithms developed to run on massive datasets and be computationally tractable. Heavily relied upon Python, Cython, Fortran, and C code. https://github.com/evanbiederstedt/CMBintheLikeHoodz
