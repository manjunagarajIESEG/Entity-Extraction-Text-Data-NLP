RF Engineer
SPRINT/ALCATEL-LUCENT/GTA
Explored and applied the big data analytical techniques to key performance indicator (KPI) driven wireless network performance and optimization.  Big Data Processing, Analysis, Mining, and Modeling:  •    Big Data Processing (Teradata/Oracle/MS SQL/Netezza, Python/Perl, and Excel/Tableau/MicroStrategy):   Developed high performance SQL to pull the big data sets (i.e. ~ 100 million samples) for analysis from database systems in cloud environment (Hadoop). Transformed the big data set for analysis by the software tools.  •    Statistical Analysis, Data Mining, and Data Modeling (DataMinerXL/R/SAS, Python, and C++):  Applied statistical techniques (correlation analysis, bucket analysis, pattern recognition, logistic regression, percentile, histogram, and contour, etc.) to analyze wireless networks performance from big KPI data sets.  •    Predictive Analysis and Algorithm Design (DataMinerXL/R/SAS, Python/Perl, and C++):  Applied predictive analysis techniques (linear and nonlinear regressions, and Holt-Winters, etc.) to model and forecast the status of the networks based on historical data sets (~120,000 sectors * 750 samples).  Designed and implemented algorithms to improve forecast accuracy and performance significantly  •    Big Data Visualization (MapInfo, and ArcGIS, etc.):  Incorporate geographic information system to visualize the analysis and forecast results. Generated maps to visualize traffic and performance of Sprint national wireless networks at sector level (~120,000 sectors).
