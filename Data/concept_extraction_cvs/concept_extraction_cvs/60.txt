Responsibilities Positronium (Ps) is the bound state atom formed by an electron and a positron, the anti-particle of the electron. It may be formed by a positron capturing an electron in a material where the free electron density is not very large. Positronium in a material has a lifetime ranging from 0.125 to 142 nanoseconds. When formed in a material, the triplet state annihilation lifetime is reduced due to annihilations of the positron bound in Ps with an electron in the medium. We determined this lifetime experimentally using gamma-ray detectors and timing electronics to measure the distribution of time delays between the formation of Ps and its subsequent decay. In this experiment we measured positron lifetimes in silica gel and zeolite, and studied the relationship between the lifetime and the pore size of the medium. Faculty Mentor: David Schoepf  Skills Used Python, Mathematica, Ortec technology, public speaking, technical writing, power point presentation
