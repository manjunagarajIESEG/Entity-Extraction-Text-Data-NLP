Research Software Engineer
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard) - Boston, MA
Research Software Engineer. Speech recognition and language technology development and software engineering supporting IDOL Speech and Broadcast Monitoring products, and government R&D contracts. Investigate and direct studies to improve audio quality and noise robustness for language identification and automatic speech recognition. Develop and deliver speech and language recognition for European, African and Asian languages and dialects, including creation of pronunciation dictionaries and text corpora. Train and tune GMM and DNN acoustic models on conventional CPU grids and NVIDIA GPUs. Contributions include:  * Upgrading our in-house speech processing engine to perform dialect identification and open-set LID (confidence based rejection), and devising optimization processes to tune the LID rejection threshold and the audio quality detection * Discriminatively training GMMs for language and dialect identification on telephone quality audio * Creating a configurable experiment automation utility with a database backend to manage LID and ASR training and evaluation, which enabled performance comparisons of thousands of combinations of languages, models, data sets, and parameters * Creating and optimizing phone sets and rule based phonetic dictionaries in over a dozen languages and dialects * Building text corpora for new languages from scratch by writing web spiders and data pipelines for the CouchDB database that supports our automated large scale ingests of news text from across the internet  * Porting an open source, neural network based speech decoder to build a RESTful web service application for speech transcription.  Programming in Python, Perl, C++ (98/11) on Linux and Windows OS; model training and decoding with HTK and Kaldi speech tools and libraries; data analysis with NumPy, SciPy, Matlab; web development in JavaScript, jQuery, CSS2; database development in MySQL, CouchDB; familiar with the programming IDEs CodeBlocks, VisualStudio, IntelliJ; experienced with usage and management of parallel processing (grid engines), Trac (ticketing and wiki), Subversion, and Ubuntu Linux and Windows systems.
