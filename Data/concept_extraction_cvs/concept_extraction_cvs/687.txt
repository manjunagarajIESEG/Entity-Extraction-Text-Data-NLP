Senior Software Engineer
Qualcomm Connected Experiences Inc
Accomplishments and projects while working for Qualcomm: • An active contributor/developer for AllJoyn, an open source, IoT/IoE proximal networking framework. • An active contributor/developer for AllJoyn.js, a JavaScript compiler/interpreter for AllJoyn Thin Client. This work included integrating an existing JavaScript engine and real time debugger (Duktape) into AllJoyn while still maintaining a small footprint (~128K RAM, 512K Flash). • Embedded software development porting AllJoyn Thin Client to different embedded platforms. Several platforms include Arduino DUE, Freescale K64, STM32, and some of Qualcomm's proprietary platforms. • Developed an open source WiFi driver for embedded platforms. This WiFi driver is designed to run on small embedded MCU's using SPI as the communication protocol between the MCU (host) and WiFi module (target). • Experience with developing both open source and proprietary software.
