Used images to extract large quantities of data, find and analyze patterns, and draw physical conclusions. Created a pipeline to process and calibrate raw image data. Developed software for a multitude of tasks including least squares fitting and polynomial regression, error analysis, and signal extraction from images using IDL and Python. Communicated results and conclusions through academic papers, talks, and posters. Wrote a successful proposal to collect additional data using the Discovery Channel Telescope for thesis project, which involved conceiving an original research problem and communicating its scientific merit and feasibility to a committee. Organized and hosted prospective graduate student visits crucial to the growing of the Physics Department.
