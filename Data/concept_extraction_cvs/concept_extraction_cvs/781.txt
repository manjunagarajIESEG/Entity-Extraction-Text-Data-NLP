Software Engineer / Employee
RANGAM CONSULTANTS, INC
At Verizon Wireless, NJ I was a part of the Geographic Information Systems team on an assignment aimed at providing additional support for geospatial map development engineers. Activities comprise assuring the availability of ESRI 10.x geospatial processing software, Weblogic, Oracle 11/12, ad hoc software installation, Python 2.7 scripting, bash scripting, and configuration maintenance of the aforementioned products. A large percentage of time is spent installing and configuring software products such as Oracle, Weblogic, SSL, Apache, and ESRI as well as other software products incidental to these products. The ESRI product suite relies heavily on Python 2.7. ESRI users rely exclusively on Python for product customization and for linkage outside of ESRI. Using Python I was able to reduce the time it took to publish all of their web services from several days to 20 minutes.
