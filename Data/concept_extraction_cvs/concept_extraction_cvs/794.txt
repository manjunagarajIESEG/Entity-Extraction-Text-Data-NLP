Software QA Lead
Starbucks - Seattle, WA
Responsibilities Lead a team of three QA engineers building a new mobile app for Starbucks retail employees. This mobile app was for both iOS and Android platforms and will be deployed to all of Starbucks retail employees. As the QA Lead I defined and established all QA processes for the  entire lifecycle of the mobile app. Some light Python development for creating and updating test data as well as formatting output into JSON. Worked with several different teams to ensure end to end cross platform deployment and testing went as smoothly as possible.
