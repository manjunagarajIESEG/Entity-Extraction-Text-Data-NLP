Research Assistant
University of Iowa
Technical Skills  • Built mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) for workforce scheduling in manufac- turers that explicitly includes workers' learning.  • Developed exact solution methodologies for realistically-sized instances.  • Extended the (MINLP) to include decisions of grouping workers based on their charac- teristics and assigning them to jobs that maximizes system throughput.  • Formulate a Markov decision process that schedules and routes technicians in hospital laboratories considering random order arrival time and uncertain service duration.  • Create simulations for computational experiments, and use Python to implement the de- vised solution methodologies.  Communication Skills  1 • Plan and arrange meeting with hospital managers, and present research ideas to them. • Present research at international conferences at least once a year.
