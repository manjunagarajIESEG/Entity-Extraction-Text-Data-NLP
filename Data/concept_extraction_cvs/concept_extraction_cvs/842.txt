consultant) * Analyzed financial data and provided support to existing data analytics needs. * Designed algorithms for financial image processing e.g. large number of financial charts were compared to pick out closely related graphs. * Converted existing adhoc data analytics jobs into automated periodic jobs requiring no active human involvement for data and report generation. * Combined the use of Python with R to widely distribute R's powerful data analytics abilities to a wider set of users and combined them with Python's strengths. * Routine use of SQL queries to extract data from massive financial databases. * Applied industrial quality control features such as robustness and ruggedness to software development so programs could be executed predictably and reliably in a wide range on environments and transferred to the cloud (AWS) on a short notice. * Lead R developer for the team and supported dev ops role of existing R processes. Converted several excel processes involving multiple analyst dependent "copy paste" processes into single validated R job improving worker productivity and eliminating human error. * Converted scattered development quality code into robust, organized production quality code. Production deployment of code and automated processes extracting data from multiple large (>100 GB) databases and performing multi step data mining/analysis, eventually providing data to traders in form of a dashboard. * Set up HPC clusters. Identified opportunities for parallelization of code to speed up processes. Set up clusters (MPI, SOCK, FORK) and modified the code to improve performance of key programs showed by over 1000 % improvement in performance). * Set up EC2, EBS, S3 and HPC clusters in AWS using both console and cloud formation. * Shell scripts (linux, awk, perl, python) for running jobs in linux environment. * Python CGI, Django webserver development on AWS.
