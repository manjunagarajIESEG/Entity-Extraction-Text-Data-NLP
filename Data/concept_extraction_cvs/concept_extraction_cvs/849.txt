Texas Integrated Eligibility Redesign System (TIERS) - Austin, TX
Texas Integrated Eligibility Redesign System (TIERS) is an integral part of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission's efforts to modernize its eligibility system.Itisann-tier, object-oriented, component-based, thin client application. It is designed following Rational Unified Process. It is divided into four major subsystems: Presentation, Business, Data and Frameworks.  Responsibilities: • Involved in Systemanalysis, design, enhancementand development of server based webapplication as well as Mobile application and developed specifications based on TX DIR Document 25SD-T1-2. • Used EclipseEuropaIDEfor development and testing of JSP, Conversations, JDBC classes and EJBs. • Involved in understanding and analyzing the project requirements • Implemented TIERS Framework by using MVC • Performed peer code reviews of application • Consumed the Web services using Apache CXF to validate the Address and SSN. • Produced the Web services using REST API to share the data across the interface. • Prepared unit test cases and executed by using JUnit • Implemented the EXT JS framework for creating Rich Web Pages. • Used XML Schema to describe the structure of the XML • Involved in creating SQL queries, stored procedures, cursors, packages and functions with back end in Oracle 10g. • Used Hibernate filters to limit the results of a query according to the current need. • Wrote SQL and implemented ORM using Hibernate. • Developed for processing all incoming xml message data from external system using SAX parsing, JAXP. • Configured the Web sphere server with build configuration, Connection Pooling, Security MW. • Creating web service component using SOAP, WSDL and XML that will receive the XML messages, apply the business rules, and interact with the business components to provide the business logic. • Extensively implemented design patterns like Front Controller, Delegate and Value Objects. • Implemented the common services of Configuration Manager, Exception Handling, and Logging (LOG4J). • Used JNDI API to look up objects (databases) from the naming/directory services. • Implemented the application using the concrete principles laid down by several design patterns such as MVC, Business Delegate, Session Facade, Service Locator, Data Access Object, and Singleton. • Involved in documenting the designing of user interfaces, business logic-rules-validationsand data modeling for several projects. • Developed custom tags, JSTL to support custom User Interfaces. • Deployed the applications on OracleWebLogic SV 10.3.0 • Used Tuxedo C services and Data Access Modules in C (DAM) for reliable and asynchronous exchange of sensitive information. • ImplementedJUnitand JAD for debugging and to develop test cases for all the functioning modules. • Used Serena PVCS Version Manager for version control across common source code used by developers. • Used ANT build tool for building the application. • Used SQR then switched to Jasper iReport tool along with Log4J to generate forms, reports and sub-reports and to capture the log that includes runtime exceptions. • WrittenStored-procedures, Snapshot-Audit-History Tables, Packages, Views, Cursors, Functions and triggers using SQL & PL/SQL.  Environment:J2EE, JDK 1.6, GRNDS FRAMEWORK, CONVERSATIONS, JDBC, JAD, JSP 2.0, JSTL, JAVA SCRIPT, CSS, EJB 3.0, C SERVICES/ DAMS, JNDI, ORACLE 10G DATABASE, TOAD, SQL, JASPER IREPORT AND SQR, XML, ANT SCRIPTS, ECLIPSEEUROPA, ORACLE WEBLOGIC 10.3.0, LOG4J, SERENAPVCS, WINDOWS XP/7, PUTTY.
