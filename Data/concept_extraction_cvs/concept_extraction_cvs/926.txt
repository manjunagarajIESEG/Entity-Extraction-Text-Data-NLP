Test Engineer
Intel-Silicon Photonics Group
Upgraded test throughput by 600x over what was present when started, from test times of 20 hours for 10 devices in R&D mode, to test times of 10 minutes for 50 devices in production mode.  •    Wrote several Matlab and Python drivers for data acquisition of silicon photonic components.  o     Automated motion control stages to allow unattended data collection.  o     Programs use GPIB and RS232 instrument control and data acquisition on Keithley Test and Measurement systems, Newport power meters, and Thorlabs stages.  o     Wrote data extraction algorithms that reduce raw data to key variable trends.  o     Designing system in Python to monitor power delivered to dozens of devices under stress. The system allows us to track changes across several power supplies in parallel, and periodically shelves the data.  •    Built most of the test and stress fixtures for the photonics reliability lab.  o     Designed a number of opto-mechanical components for test mounts.  •    Designed, assembled and tested PCBs; collaborated with other employees in assembling and testing boards.  o     Designed 50 channel programmable current driver, with simple firmware in C.  o     Designed smart stress board, which facilitates both the burn-in, aging and testing of several Integrated Circuits in parallel using fully automated test routines. Scaled up to the primary reliability test method for the SPSG group.  •    Produced documentation for technicians on how to operate lab instruments and tests. Prepared bill of materials for tests.  •    Had primary ownership of monitor photodiode qualification: built all test equipment, collected and analyzed all data required. General Experience •    Developed sensor daughter card with altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass, which communicate over I2C bus. Also decoded and debugged I2C on the sensor card using both a bitscope and Saleae analyzer. Currently writing C libraries for interface.
