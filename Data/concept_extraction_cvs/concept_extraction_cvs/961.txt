Training Coordinator
Continuum Analytics - Austin, TX
Responsibilities After the sales team makes a Python training sale, I start working with the client to plan their training. I schedule the dates and assign a trainer. I organize a conference call with the client and trainer to discuss details and expectations. I arrange travel for the trainer. I order materials to be sent to the training site as well as prepare the students for training by sending a pre-course email with instructions about how to prep computers and gather background information to pass along to the trainer. I help troubleshoot problems that may arise during the training and gather feedback from the students through a post-course survey.   Accomplishments I helped organize the training team to help Continuum be more successful.   Skills Used I used my communication and organization skills. I effectively communicated with colleagues and clients via email, phone calls, video conferences and face to face. I used calendars, documents and spreadsheets to organize trainings.
